# Restif
A Web server that provides a REST+Json interface for a local MySQL server.
Source code is provided for Python3 and C#, and for a simple RESTClient in C# for testing the mechanisms.
This is the beginning of a Web database programming project. The Word document so far contains only the setting up chapter and appendices.
The appendices contain a full walkthrough of the construction of both versions and instructions for setting up a CentOS VM for experimentation.
